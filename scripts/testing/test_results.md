# DynamoDB Testing Results
Date: October 23, 2024
Tester: Andrea

## Connection Test
- Successfully connected to AWS DynamoDB
- Found 1 table: products-demo

## CRUD Operations Test
- CREATE: Successfully created 2 products
- READ: Successfully retrieved product data
- UPDATE: Successfully updated product price
- LIST: Retrieved all products (2 items)
- DELETE: Successfully deleted product

## Load Test Results
- Duration: 10 seconds
- Target: 5 operations/second
- Total Operations: 35
- Success Rate: 37.1%
- Actual throughput: 3.3 ops/second

## Issues Found
1. Read operations on non-existent items counted as failures
2. Success rate lower than expected (37.1%)
3. Actual throughput (3.3 ops/s) below target (5 ops/s)

## Cost Estimation
- Operations performed: ~50 total
- Estimated cost: < $0.01 (On-Demand pricing)
- At 1000 ops/sec: ~$25/month
- At 100 ops/sec: ~$2.5/month

## Recommendations
1. Implement retry logic for failed operations
2. Add error handling for throttling
3. Consider Provisioned capacity for consistent workloads
